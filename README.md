# leroy-in-space-asteroids
a copy of the popular arcade game asteroids but with new features to help me learn python, the pygame module and a variety of programming concepts

as this was primarily made as a learning oppurtunity it is scruffy in many places and i am continuing to work on it so not everything works

if you want to give it a go just run the main.py and you will get a start menu which allows you to check controls and change the window resolution
the game also has joystick support however the specific brands it supports is out of my control
